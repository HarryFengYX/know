A program to know what you know


Inmagine, by just using your own notes, you program can also know what you know.

For example, you can take notes of your econ class. You put yoour class notes in a html file, and then, you are set. Your program can now know everything you recorded! Let's try searching 'market'. It will search which tag has name attribute 'market'. As a result, it will give you information of the parent tag, and the children tags. It follows logic. Also, there will be a time you can tell it to distinguish whether 'market' is a concept of microeconomics or macroeconomics.

But right now, you must create the html file to let your program use bs4 to parse through it. This process can be facilitated by some front end magic, which I don't currently have. If you can do that, let's be friends.
